My first Github repo
Learnt a lot this far, the difference between git and Github.
Have had a Github account for close two years but never used it till now that have been able to gain understanding how it works.
Fantastic.
Have learnd on how to use the termal and set a git and even been able to use a few line of commands to set a repo on Github and download on my local machine.

Now I want to embark on first project ever working on a Linux environment, its a totally new experience and am super exciting just getting to move around the Command Line or Terminal
